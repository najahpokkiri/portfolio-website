compare-spectra: a simple Earth Engine app for spectral analysis

Made a small Earth Engine app to do quick spectral analysis.
You can select areas, draw ROIs, and compare spectra with just a few clicks.
No coding needed. Just open and start exploring.

You can also export the line charts as images or download the spectral data as CSV.

Main features:

-	Select and compare multiple ROIs
-	Line charts to visualise spectra
-	Export charts and data
-	Free and open source
-	Built fully on GEE – no install needed

Built this mostly because I wanted something lightweight and easy for quick comparisons, without opening Jupyter or writing scripts.

Here’s the link: [compare-spectra app](https://najah.users.earthengine.app/view/compare-spectra)

Let me know if you find it useful or if you have suggestions.

Here’s a quick demo:
