### Overview

In 2024, I co-developed **NatCat** with my colleague Gautam Dadich. NatCat is a platform for natural catastrophe response that was selected for the prestigious [**Prototypes for Humanity 2024**](https://www.prototypesforhumanity.com/project/natcat/) exhibition in Dubai. The project was designed to bridge the critical information gap during disasters by providing an intuitive, centralized platform for rapid situational awareness using near-real-time satellite data.

The project's impact was further recognized by ***Live Science***, which featured NatCat as one of the [**16 Tech Projects From 2023 That Could Change the World**](https://www.livescience.com/technology/16-tech-projects-from-2023-that-could-change-the-world).

As a lead developer on the project, my responsibilities covered key aspects of the project lifecycle, from R&D and data sourcing to building the back-end processing workflows in Google Earth Engine and designing the user interface.
