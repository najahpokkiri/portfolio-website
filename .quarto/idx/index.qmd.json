My background is in liberal arts from Ashoka University, India, and over the last few years, I‚Äôve worked on geospatial projects across climate, conflict, conservation, and urban development.\n\nI‚Äôve worked with two Earth observation startups‚Äîone focused on monitoring natural capital, the other on satellite intelligence for media. My projects include estimating biomass using multi-sensor satellite data, mapping conflict damage in Gaza and Ukraine with SAR interferometry, and building ML models to predict soil carbon across Indian states.\n\nMost of my work blends Earth observation with applied machine learning‚Äîthings like deep learning on remote sensing data, time series modeling, and multi-resolution data fusion. I‚Äôve also presented at conferences like COP28 and Google Geo for Good.\n\nI currently also support teaching at the Ashoka Centre for Data Science. I‚Äôm open to part-time, contract, or full-time opportunities in geospatial data science‚Äîespecially projects with real-world impact. -->\n\n<!-- I am a data scientist with a keen interest in using remote sensing and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I graduated from Ashoka University in India with a liberal arts degree, and I have worked on data science projects in the domains of policy, urbanisation, climate, and sustainability.\n\nCurrently, I work as a data science consultant for an earth observation start up. In addition to this role, I've always enjoyed teaching others, so I jumped at the opportunity to take on a part-time teaching assistant position with the Professional and Executive Development Programme at the Ashoka Centre for Data Science and Analytics. This allows me to share my knowledge while continuing to build my career as a data science consultant. I am also actively looking for new opportunities in the geospatial data science domain. -->\n\n\n<!-- --- -->\n<!-- title: \"Posts\" -->\n<!-- listing: -->\n<!--   contents: posts -->\n<!--   sort:
