I am a data scientist with a keen interest in using satellite imagery, remote sensing, and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I graduated from Ashoka University in India with a liberal arts degree and am currently pursuing my master’s in Geodesy and Geoinformation at TU Berlin. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on geospatial data science projects in the domains of climate, conflict, conservation, and urban development.

Most recently, I worked as a data scientist for two Earth observation startups—one focused on monitoring natural capital and the other on providing satellite intelligence to media organisations. My projects included estimating biomass using multi-sensor satellite data, mapping conflict damage in Gaza and Ukraine using SAR interferometry, and building machine learning models to predict soil carbon across Indian states. These projects have drawn on a range of geospatial techniques, including deep learning for remote sensing and time series analysis. I’ve also represented my work at international conferences such as COP28 and Google Geo for Good.

In addition to consulting, I currently work as a teaching assistant for an executive programme at the Ashoka Centre for Data Science, where I help mid-career professionals learn data science skills. I am open to short-term or part-time consulting roles in the geospatial data science domain, particularly those that combine Earth observation and machine learning for social or environmental impact.

<!-- I am a data scientist with a keen interest in using remote sensing and machine learning to solve real-world problems. I graduated from Ashoka University in India with a liberal arts degree, and I have worked on data science projects in the domains of policy, urbanisation, climate, and sustainability.

Currently, I work as a data science consultant for an earth observation start up. In addition to this role, I've always enjoyed teaching others, so I jumped at the opportunity to take on a part-time teaching assistant position with the Professional and Executive Development Programme at the Ashoka Centre for Data Science and Analytics. This allows me to share my knowledge while continuing to build my career as a data science consultant. I am also actively looking for new opportunities in the geospatial data science domain. -->
